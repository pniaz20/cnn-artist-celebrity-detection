# cnn-artist-celebrity-detection

Convolutional Neural Network for Artist and Celebrity Detection.

Here, we will use PyTorch to perform two tasks. In the first task, we will train a CNN model to detect which artist a painting was made by. 
In the second task, we will train a CNN model to detect celebrities from their images.
